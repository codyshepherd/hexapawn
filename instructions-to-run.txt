This program requires Java 8 installed to compile. For some reason, the linuxlab machines have the
experimental OpenJDK Java 9 set by default. However, this program will compile and run on the linuxlab if Java 8
is enabled.

Enabling Java 8 and instructions to run this program follow:

1. Enable Java 8 on linux by running `addpkg` at the command line and selecting Java 8 in the ensuing GUI.

2. `cd` to the top level of this project.
    i.e., `ls` should show this file, the Makefile, the writeup, and directories src and tests

3. to compile, execute Makefile with `make`
    This will put compiled binaries in $PWD/out

4. run the binary using the included `solve.sh` bash script
    ./solve.sh

Appropriately formatted text files can be piped into this program, e.g.:

    ./solve.sh < sometest.txt
